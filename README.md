## :tada: :clap: WELCOME :clap: :tada:

Welcome to my site, feel free to navigate through it, and **contact me** if you have any *suggestions*, *questions* or if you want to **recruit me**. Or maybe if you just want to contact me because you need it :wink:. 

The website is now hosted online by **Netlify**, you can find it here : https://titouan-galvani.netlify.com/ !
<br><br>
## What is this ?

My website is a small, simple and easy one. I use only **HTML**, **SASS**, **Pure CSS** and some **native Javascript** and **particles.js** for the homepage for now, but I will upgrade it so it looks really great as the days passed. I don't put some advanced frameworks as VueJS (only implemented yet) or backend like NodeJS or any database. Yeah I know, i'ts lame :no_mouth:.
<br><br>
## What about me ? 

My name is **Titouan Galvani**, I'm a french **web developer**, and currently a 3<sup>rd</sup> year **student** at [Ynov Lyon](https://www.ynov.com/). I'm currently learning, so if not everything is perfect, i'ts completely normal. My next step is to master **VueJS** and **native Javascript**, and of course **HTML** and **CSS/SASS** at the same time. I am planning on master some **back-end** technology such as **NodeJS** (with *Meteor* and *React* at the same time maybe) and **Laravel** for *PHP*.

### Personal questions
#### How old are you ?
I'm currently 20 years old. :man:

#### How long have you been coding ?
I'ts been 3 years now :grimacing:, I'm a really young developer, so I have many things to learn and master.

#### How do you learn stuff ?
I follow my formation at [Ynov Lyon](https://www.ynov.com/), i'ts a developer and programming (web and application) and systems and networks oriented formation. Also, I try to learn on my own by navigating on the net and find some projects to do with new technologies :books:. 

### Tech questions
#### What code editor do you use ?
I used to code with **Atom** in my second year, I switched to **PHP Storm** for my intership at Webqam (so about 6/7 weeks). Now I'm fully using **VSCode** which I :heart:.

#### What Javascript library do you like the most ?
For now, I really like **VueJS** and what comes around (Vuetify, Vue UI, NuxtJS ...). But I don't have much experience with the others so I guess VueJS for now.

### Fun questions
#### McDonald's or Big Fernand ? :hamburger: 
Really ? Big Fernand 10000%, except for the price maybe :thinking:.

#### Coffee :coffee: or tea :tea: ?
I don't drink either so ... water ?

#### Night :bridge_at_night: or day :city_sunrise: ?
I prefer to work at night, and if I could, I would not sleep at all. I feel like I'm losing my time when I'm sleeping :sleeping:. But I need to, otherwise I will collapsed. 

#### If you were an animal, what would you be :dog: :pig: :cow: :bug: :penguin: :octocat: ?
:cat: A cat definitely, because I love cats, and I'm a developer, so I'm lazy. Long 9 lives to :cat2: !

#### Last question ... Are you all right ?
Of course I am :smiley:, you are reading this right now, which means some people saw this repo and read all the way down here ! So yes, I'm happy :relieved:!
