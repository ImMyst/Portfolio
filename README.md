## :tada: :clap: WELCOME :clap: :tada:

Welcome to my site, feel free to navigate through it, and **contact me** if you have any *suggestions*, *questions* or if you want to **recruit me**. Or maybe if you just want to contact me because you need it :wink:. 
<br><br>
## What is this ?

My website is a small, simple and easy one. I use only **HTML**, **SASS**, **Pure CSS** and some **native Javascript** for now, but I will upgrade it so it looks really great as the days passed. I don't put some advanced frameworks as VueJS (only implemented yet) or backend like NodeJS or any database. Yeah I know, i'ts lame :no_mouth:.

For now, the website is hosted locally at my place, so don't search everywhere and ask everyone where to find it, you just can't. I think I will use **Netlify** or **Now** to have a good hosting system.

## What about me ? 

My name is **Titouan Galvani**, I'm a french **web developer**, and currently a 3<sup>rd</sup> year **student** at [Ynov Lyon](https://www.ynov.com/). I'm currently learning, so if not everything is perfect, i'ts completely normal. My next step is to master **VueJS** and **native Javascript**, and of course **HTML** and **CSS/SASS** at the same time. I am planning on master some **back-end** technology such as **NodeJS** (with *Meteor* and *React* at the same time maybe) and **Laravel** for *PHP*.
